  With mobile communication and computing becoming popular, demands for the miniaturization and higher performance of information equipments are growing. The vibrational friction motor has a high potential as an actuator for micro-sized memories and output devises since it has a simple structure and uses friction force that is a dominant force in micro domain. The prototype motor has been manufactured (1), but the method of design and estimation has not been established yet because the driving mechanism of the motor is complicated due to the sequence motion of vibration, collision, and friction.

Figure 1 shows the structure of the vibrational friction motor. The stator consists of oscillators with PZT film. Figure 2 shows the process of the driving force being generated. The driving mechanism is such that the stator is excited at the resonant frequency by PZT, and the stator top collides with the rotor obliquely, and the frictional force generates the tangential force to the rotor surface. The driving force of this motor depends on both the vibrational condition of the stator and the contact condition between the stator and the rotor. As the first step, the driving force is estimated qualitatively by analyzing only the vibration of stator by FEM. Next, the instrument to measure colliding force is fabricated and the influence of the coefficient of restitution and the coefficient of friction is clarified experimentally.
A New Medium: Know the Potential, Recognize Limits, and Inform Clients
The Internet and mobile communications revolution provides people with new ways to interact with each other. Today, people around the globe can communicate easily, directly, and immediately via text, voice, and even videoconferencing. Within the past several years, visitors to health and mental health websites have been able to locate and even communicate with various professionals online. Yet, when an individual practitioner or organization is tempted to simply go online and offer professional service to the global community, it is crucial that they remember that not all clients and/or situations can or should be dealt with online. Some situations require in-office treatment or assessment. For example, it may be inappropriate to use the online modality with a client who poses a risk of danger to self or others. In times of emergency or when there is real threat to a person’s wellbeing, online communications are an insufficient treatment modality. Following are some situations in which online consults are not recommended:

•
If a client has thoughts of hurting or killing him/herself

•
If a client has thoughts of hurting or killing another person

•
If a client is in a life-threatening or emergency situation of any kind

•
If a client has a recent history of suicidal, violent, or abusive behavior

•
If a client holds what others may consider to be unrealistic beliefs (delusions)

•
If a client sees or hears things that others do not (hallucinations)

•
If a client is actively abusing alcohol or drugs
