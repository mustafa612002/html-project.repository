Mobile phone and tablet batteries have come a long way since it’s inception. From being the bulk of the mass of an ordinary phone back in the 90’s to being one of the lightest components these days. However, phones have gotten a tad light too and even now the battery can be said to be roughly half the phone’s weight. Battery technology has also come a long way, in the early days a phone needed to be recharged every 12-16 hours and now we hear of a battery that can last a month. This is a bit ambiguous as usage plays a huge factor in the life of a battery. With the advent of smartphones running heavy duty processors the current consumption has gone up again to the point that you need to charge your phone once a day, again.Battery typesThere are several types of batteries in use today like NiMH (Nickel Metal-hydride), NiCd (Nickel Cadmium) but the most popular would be the Li-ion (Lithium Ion) battery. It pretty much comes down to the manufacturer as NiMH and NiCd are cheap but they require frequent recharging and don’t hold as much charge as LiPo(Lithium Polymer) or Li-ion These have been proven to hold enormous amount of electric charge while reducing recharge time. In the last two years itself, companies have come up with more different types of batteries than in the past decade. However, it will be some time before we get to see these enter mainstream usage. Batteries are manufactured according to their usage conditions and hence what may be really efficient in the automotive sector would not perform at par in another form factor. Battery ratingWhen you flip your mobile battery, you’re bound to see a few figures here and there. These figures include certification emblems, safety standards applicable and most importantly the battery type, voltage rating and the battery capacity. A battery is called so as it contains multiple cells, each of which is capable of carrying a certain charge of its own. However, this is very little for general use and thus multiple cells are combined in series/parallel to increase the voltage as well as current capacity.The voltage rating simply gives the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery. This is pretty much fixed depending upon the type of chemicals used in the construction of the battery. For Li-ion batteries it can be 3.6v, 3.7v or 3.2v.Charge rating is shown using the unit mAh (milliAmpere-hour). One ampere-hour is equal to 3600 coulombs. Batteries are rated by these two parameters, i.e. voltage and current capacity (mAh). 
The battery life or capacity can be calculated from the input current rating of the battery and the load current of the circuit. Battery life will be high when the load current is less and vice versa. The calculation to find out the capacity of battery can be mathematically derived from the below formulaBattery Life (hours) = (Battery capacity in milliAmpere-hour)/(Load current in milliAmpere-hour) the battery capacity will be mentioned on the battery jacket but the load current being a variable is difficult to figure out. Since it depends on a multitude of factors like the types of components powered on at the moment, each of which consumes a bit of charge. The battery life mentioned on the product packaging cannot really be used to compare one phone to another properly, sure it can give an approximation but since different manufacturers use different methodologies to test the battery life, there exists no standard. Some might test conservatively by just inserting one SIM and not using the phone at all. Others might switch on GPRS, WiFi and Bluetooth and test. Obviously, the latter will show less battery life but on a standard testing scale this may not be the case at all. 
Battery careGood care must be taken to ensure that a battery lasts a long life, this includes paying attention to it’s charging cycles, the temperature, using the proper charger etc. Here are a few pointers you need to keep in mind.Your Li-ion battery has a limited number of charge cycles, as time progresses the capacity of the battery is going to reduce by a little bit till the point that you cannot afford to unplug the charger from your phone at all. Also, you really shouldn’t be using a phone while it is charging, they tend to get pretty hot and you risk being one of those lucky few whose phone blows up during use. An average Li-ion battery lasts about 1200 charge cycles. Given there are 365 days in a year and let’s say you charge 300 times a year, your battery should last 4 years before needing a replacement provided you take care of your battery.Li-ion batteries also suffer from what is termed the memory effect. When a battery is charged after having only been partially discharged, it sort of “remembers” the partial capacity, so the battery will show that it is fully charged when it actually is not. Given the cut-off mechanisms in phones these days, when a battery tells that it is full the phone stops the charging, thus as your progress through charging cycles your battery life reduces by a small amount each time. This is why you should always discharge your phone as much as possible before commencing another charge cycle(i.e plugging the charger in). It was claimed that Li-ion batteries do not suffer from the memory effect, however, recent studies have shown that they do suffer from the memory effect but not the extent that NiMH and NiCd batteries do.Use as few of your phone’s features as necessary to reduce consumption. Switch off Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G when not needed. Smart phones these days come with a quick menu wherein these features can be managed without much fuss. Adjust the screen brightness to a level that is easy on the eyes and at the same time lower that half the screen’s brightness to ensure a long discharge cycle.An important factor for phones slightly older would be to use the proper charger that came with it, as the amperage of the current inflow may cause the battery to bloat if it is higher than what the battery was designed to handle. Nowadays phones  use USB to charge so any compatible outlet should do fine but stay away from cheap chargers as they might not be up to standard and could cause some damage to your device.Here is a good article on taking care of your battery - http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Cell-Phone-Battery-Last-Longer
Display technologyDisplay technology has come a long way since the day of miniature screen whose sole purpose was to display the phone number and the name of the caller. Displays these days are pretty much miniature television screens capable of playing full HD 1080p signal. There isn’t much to differentiate between the technology that lies in your TV from that in your phone. Some screens are difficult to manufacture on a scale fit for television, that’s all.Let’s have a look at the common tech behind your phone displays and a little insight into which is better in terms of viewing experience and energy efficiency.
 TFT-LCDThe predecessor to all displays in the market, TFT-LCD (often termed simply as LCD) are by far the most used display tech, simply because there are a lot of manufacturers offering these and it thus has a good competitive economy about it. If your phone is a mid-range model then most probably it has this type of display but even the high-end Nexus 7 has this display.TFT stands for thin-film transistor liquid crystal display and there are many different ways of manufacturing these screens, so just by calling it a TFT wouldn’t be of much help to you. Just like in desktop display where VA, TN and IPS, even mobile devices have a lot of different technologies. Thus, they show the same characteristics as desktop displays, i.e. varied colour reproduction, washed out colours at extreme viewing angles etc.The drawback about TFT displays are that they are pretty thick and are the major contributing factor to the device’s thickness, the other being the battery of course. High quality LCD screens will have bright, accurate colours and with visibility from just about any angle.AMOLEDAMOLED (Active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) is a screen technology based on organic compounds that offers remarkably better image quality along with potentially very low power usage.
Till OLED screens came into the picture, all display technologies needed a backlight. This was the reason for their thickness, and each pixel would only control the colour shade. This also meant that the backlight would remain on and this 100% of the screen would be on. Unlike LCD screens, AMOLED displays don't need a backlight - each pixel produces its own light - so phones using them can potentially be thinner. Also, since each pixel can be turned off on its own this mean that certain portions of the screen which would be displaying black colour could be turned off completely, this is what most people term as true black, i.e. absence of any light.It also means that a mostly black screen will use very little electricity, and watching videos the colour reproduction was much better as opposed to TFT where dark regions would be reproduced as dark grey rather than true black.This being said, AMOLED screens are rather expensive to produce in terms of cost and time, hence, you’ll find these screens only in the upper mid-range and top-end products. Another drawback is that on a sub-pixel level, the arrangement of the subpixel is rather different as compared to LCD, thus there will be a slight distortion when compared to an LCD. High-end LCD screens which are found on certain top-end phones are capable of outdoing the colour reproduction capability of AMOLED screens.Super AMOLEDAn improvement over traditional AMOLED screens, Super AMOLED screen has superior brightness and colour reproduction. What is primarily different is that these screens have the capacitive touchscreen included in the manufacturing process and do not use a digitizer overlay as is the case in other screens.Super AMOLED PlusThe subpixel arrangement of AMOLED screens led to a slightly distorted image being produced, with the advent of Super AMOLED Plus, this was fixed as the subpixel arrangement was modified to resemble that of an LCD, thus ensuring a cleaner image.Super AMOLED HDA step ahead and then a step back, Super AMOLED HD screens had higher resolution but it ended up going back to the subpixel arrangement of normal AMOLED screens. So essentially, the distortion in the image would be so negligible that most casual users wouldn’t notice it. So the expensive process of subpixel arrangement correction was ditched to make cheap, high-resolution images. Retina displayWhen observed closely any display will show the individual pixels on it, but as you move away from the screen this individuality is less visible and you observe a cleaner image. So basically when you increase the pixel density (number of pixels per unit area) the distance at which pixelation is not apparent becomes lesser. So you can hold the screen closer to you is still see a clean image. This is what Apple did, there was no new technology behind the retina display, at the end of the day it all came down to marketing mumbo jumbo. Most screens these days have similar or greater pixel density, so pretty much every display is a “retina” display.Super-LCDSuper-LCD or SLCD is a TFT screen but with characteristics similar to an AMOLED screen, so there is better black colour reproduction which is comparable to that of AMOLED screens. It still has a backlight but is considerably power efficient as compared to the regular TFT screen.Touchscreen - Capacitive or ResistiveTouchscreens are a vital component of smartphones these days, almost all major platforms have migrated to using touchscreens instead of keypads mostly because of the versatility that a touchscreen offers. Touchscreens are what recognizes where on the screen you’ve placed your finger or stylus and communicates the co-ordinates to the phone CPU accordingly.There are two popular types of touchscreens available on devices these days, one is the resistive touchscreen and the other is the capacitive touchscreen. The resistive touchscreen has two layers (separated by a miniscule gap) which form an overlay over the screen. When a finger is placed on any point on the screen, the two form a contact and the co-ordinates are obtained. These are relatively cheap to make and are rightly found on most budget phones. The downside is that a certain amount of pressure is required to register a touch so as time goes by some degree of damage does occur to the screen.

The downside is that a certain amount of pressure is required to register a touch so as time goes by some degree of damage does occur to the screen.The other type is the capacitive touchscreen which has the entire screen coated with a capacitive substance which holds a certain amount of electrical charge, when a conducting object like a finger is placed on the screen, there is a change in capacitance on that point and thus the coordinates are obtained. Capacitive touchscreens don’t respond well in cold climates where the human finger doesn’t cause a change in capacitance, thus a stylus is recommended for such scenarios.Then there are multi-touch touchscreens wherein almost all fingers can be pinpointed accurately. This has led to an increase in the number of gestures that one can perform on a touchscreen.BluetoothBluetooth is a protocol that allows data transfer between two devices over short distances. It’s ever increasing popularity has led to a plethora of Bluetooth supported accessories for mobile devices with hands-free headsets being the most popular.Manufacturers have come up with remarkable applications for this technology, however, most of them are being replicated using Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi though slightly more power consuming offers greater range and bandwidth, thus allowing faster and low latency access times. But this did not spell the end of Bluetooth as battery woes will never leave the smartphone and tablets alone in the near future, so a low power option like Bluetooth is a necessity. With Bluetooth 4.0 now appearing in most new devices, it now offers the similar range and bandwidth as that of Wi-Fi but with a lot less power consumption.
Since bluetooth is backwards compatible your old accessories can be used with new devices without much issues, these being that you‘d not be able to reap the benefits of the new features that each revision brings with it. Here is a simple table highlighting the differences between different bluetoothWi-FiWi-Fi or IEEE 802.11 is an older protocol for data transfer but consumed much more power and offered higher range and bandwidth. Wi-Fi too has undergone multiple revisions with multiple improvements in each revision that led to a much efficient system for data transfer.
